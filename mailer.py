"""
Outbound email — acknowledgement & resolution notices to clients.

Sends via Microsoft Graph API (app-only OAuth, client credentials flow),
using a Mail.Send application permission scoped to the support@ mailbox via
an Exchange Application Access Policy. Configured entirely through
environment variables. Until GRAPH_CLIENT_ID/GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET/
GRAPH_TENANT_ID are set, send_email() safely no-ops (logs and returns False)
so ticket actions never fail because email isn't wired up yet.
